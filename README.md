# Sample template repository for projects

This sample repository is designed to help you quickly set up a new project with best practices in mind. It includes prompt files, chatmodes, useful mcp servers, gitignore instructions and so on.

Please modify the following files to suit your needs:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Add specific GitHub Copilot instructions for your repository.
- `.gitignore`: Add the contents of the `.gitignore` file that you need, taken from [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: Configure your development container settings, maybe by taking inspiration [from here](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates).
- `.github/workflows/main.yml`: Add your GitHub Actions workflow(s) maybe by cloning existing ones [from here](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows).
- `.vscode/mcp.json`: Configure MCP servers for your project.
- All files under `docs/`: Add your project documentation and files (images, diagrams, etc.) as needed.

There are other files already provided, like the various [chatmodes](.github/chatmodes/) and [prompts](.github/prompts/) which you can customize further based on your project requirements.
